SHADERS
---------------------------------------
In the simplest possible configuration, you will need two shaders : 
one called Vertex Shader, which will be executed for each vertex, 
and one called Fragment Shader, which will be executed for each sample.

Shaders are programmed in a language called GLSL : GL Shader Language, 
which is part of OpenGL. Unlike C or Java, GLSL has to be compiled at 
run time, which means that each and every time you launch your application, 
all your shaders are recompiled.
